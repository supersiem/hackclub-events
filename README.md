## AI

I used AI to help with the following tasks:

- Fix this README (I'm not a native English speaker and have dyslexia, so this makes it readable).
- Fixing a bug where deleting a character in the search bar didn't update the results after I tried for about 30 minutes.
- Creating the initial list layout, I can't make a layout to save my life.

All other logic and project setup outside these points was done by me.
